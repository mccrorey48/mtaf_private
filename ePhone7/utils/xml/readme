These files are used to get updated information about the screen tab
elements from the r2d2 after a new r2d2 software release

view_info.py contains information on the tab elements to be inspected; edit as needed

Once view_info.py contains the right information describing the view elements,
run the utilities in the order listed:

  get_xml.py -    queries the Appium server to get xml files and screenshots (in .png format)
                  for each view described in view_info.py

  xml_to_csv.py - converts the xml files to a concise csv format including element id's, xpaths (in
                  condensed zpath format) and element coordinates

Screenshot files are collected for each view with each of the possible tabs selected in
that view (for example, there are 4 screenshots for the contacts view, one for each of
the tabs: Personal, Coworkers, Favorites and Groups).

Screenshots are used during test operations to determine if a tab is in the selected or unselected state.
Tabs are colored with a gradient backround, so there is a specific, narrow horizontal line that is evaluated
to make this determination. The crop points that define this line are determined by trial and error to get a
reliable result; the color values and crop points are saved in config/colors.json for use during the test.
