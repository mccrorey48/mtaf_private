The getxml.py utililty is used to get updated information about the screen
elements from the ePhone7 after a new software release.

This utility will navigate by selecting each of the bottom row of buttons (Contacts, History, Voicemail, Dial),
and then selecting each tab available in for that selection. For each of the resulting views, a screenshot image and
xml data are saved.

Data is also collected for other views, including active call, incoming call, preferences and advanced settings.

Once the image and xml files are saved, the xml data is converted to a csv format with a line for each item listed
in the xml file.  This line includes an abbreviated version of the xpath for that item, id (if any), location, size,
and text content (if any).

This information is useful when designing test code that needs to query or interact with visual elements on the
ePhone7 screen during the test operations.
