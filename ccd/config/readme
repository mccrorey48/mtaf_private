Using json files to manage test system configuration in the Mongo database

To see what is in the mongo db (on 10.0.50.15) for use by the test framework:
    cd to the ccd_cron/svauto_shared directory
    run "python dbutils.py dump all --stdout"

To save the current database contents to ccd_locators.json, passwords.json and test_accounts.json in
ccd_cron/svauto_shared/config:
    cd to the ccd_cron/svauto_shared directory
    run "python dbutils.py dump all"
This creates new versions of the three json files.  The passwords.json file is considered dynamic
and is in the .gitignore file so changes will not be committed or shown by "git status",
since passwords are changed when the ccd_cron/cron_script is run.  The other two files will only
be shown as "modified" by the git status command if the corresponding database content has been
modified (either from the mongo command line or by using the dbutils.py "restore" option, which is
preferred).

To make a change to the existing database content:
    cd to the ccd_cron/svauto_shared directory
    run "python dbutils.py dump all"
    cd to the config directory
    make changes in the .json files
    cd back to ccd_cron/svauto_shared
    run "python dbutils.py restore all"
