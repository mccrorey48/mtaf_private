The "mtaf/lib/lib_test" directory contains scripts for testing modules in the "mtaf/lib" directory.

They usually need to be run from the "mtaf" directory, which is the root directory for importing other mtaf modules.

If the test script uses the "esi_logging" module, the output files will then be in "mtaf/log".
