Before packaging mtaf for release on PyPi, verify that everything works
as expected in the local environment (running from the source tree).

To run inspector from the local enviroment, first create a new virtualenv
named "clean" with the command

    "mkvirtualenv clean"

This will create the new virtualenv named "clean" and activate it.  The only
package installed will be pkgutils.

From the working directory mtaf/package, install required packages for MTAF
Inspector with this command:

    "pip install -r packaging_requirements.txt"

From the working directory mtaf/run_inspector, run the command:

    "PYTHONPATH=python run_local_inspector.py"

After verifying that inspector and any other generic mtaf modules are ready
to release, perform these steps to upload to PyPi:

1. Bump the release number in mtaf/package/mtaf/setup.py (the upload to PyPi
will be rejected if the release number does not change).

2. Remove any files from mtaf/package/mtaf/dist

3. From the working directory mtaf/package/mtaf, build the "wheel" file in the
"dist" directory with the command:

    "python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal"

4. upload to test.pypi.org with the command:

    "twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*"

    A username and password for a test.pypi.org user account will be required.
    This info can be placed in ~.pypi (in clear text!) to make the twine command
    run without asking for a username and password.

4. To test the uploaded code, install mtaf from test.pypi.org:

    run "deactivate" to get out of the "clean" virtualenv

    run "rmvirtualenv clean"

    run "mkvirtualenv clean"

    cd to your home directory to get out of the mtaf source tree

    run "pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ mtaf"

    run "mtaf-inspector"

5. If everything ran OK from test.pypi.org, upload to pypi.org. From the working
 directory mtaf/package/mtaf, run the commands:

    "twine upload dist/*"

    This requires a username and password for pypi.org. The account setup
    is distinct from the one used for test.pypi.org.

6. Test the uploaded code by installing mtaf from pypi.org:

    run "deactivate" to get out of the "clean" virtualenv

    run "rmvirtualenv clean"

    run "mkvirtualenv clean"

    cd to your home directory to get out of the mtaf source tree

    run "pip install mtaf"

    run "mtaf-inspector"
